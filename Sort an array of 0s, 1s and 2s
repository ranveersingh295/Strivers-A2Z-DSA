Dutch National flag algorithm
OPTIMAL APPROACH
Time Complexity: O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: We are using a single loop that can run at most N times.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

class Solution {
    public static void sort012(int arr[], int n) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1;
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                int temp = arr[low];
                arr[low] = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = temp;
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                int temp = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = arr[high];
                arr[high] = temp;
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
}
